    "Welcome to this POSNNET use case example. This notebook presents an example of how to use the framework in a real-world scenario. It is a complementary resource to the user guide notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here is the use case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tony and Johnny developed a device designed for runners to analyze their training sessions and competitions. The device is capable of outputting both position and velocity data. These outputs are then processed to derive various performance metrics for the runner. Since runners typically analyze their sessions after completing them, postprocessing is a suitable solution rather than requiring real-time computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Device description</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "The device is equipped with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**, consisting of an accelerometer and a gyroscope, both providing data across three axes at a frequency of 100 Hz.\n",
    "- A **GPS chip**, which provides velocity data across three axes at a frequency of 10 Hz.\n",
    "- A **data fusion algorithm**, which combines the IMU and GPS data to output final position and velocity at a frequency of 100 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Problem observed</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some users experience GPS outages during usage. Because the output position and velocity depend heavily on GPS data, the accuracy of the results drops significantly during these outages. Tony and Johnny have identified two main scenarios where GPS outages occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **At the beginning of a session**, when the user starts indoors. In this case, GPS outages last between 10 and 30 seconds.\n",
    "- **Within a session**, when the user passes through areas with poor GPS coverage (e.g., forests or mountains). These outages last between 20 seconds and 10 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, they observed that when multiple GPS outages occur within a session, there is always at least 10 seconds of operational GPS data between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Solution</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "They decided to use the POSNNET framework, which is particularly well-suited for their problem. To maximize efficiency and meet both short-term and long-term goals, they chose to work in parallel:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tony** will run the framework with minimal parameters to quickly obtain a usable solution. This version is intended to provide immediate improvements and be deployed to clients who are dissatisfied with the loss of accuracy during GPS outages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Johnny** will run the framework using more robust parameters to produce a more accurate and stable solution. Once finalized, Johnny’s solution will replace Tony’s temporary version in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Tony and Johnny have access to a system equipped with a suitable GPU capable of handling the framework’s computational requirements. Tony will use a **dedicated computing node** to perform the tuning, ensuring that all resources are available exclusively for his tasks. Johnny, on the other hand, will use a **shared computing node**, meaning that the available resources may be distributed among multiple users.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Note</u> \n",
    "\n",
    "Tony and Johnny are used in this example to illustrate two different usage scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tony** represents a case where you have limited time and/or low computational resources.  \n",
    "- **Johnny** represents a case where you have plenty of time and/or access to a powerful computing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples help demonstrate how to adapt the use of the POSNNET framework based on available resources and urgency.\n"
